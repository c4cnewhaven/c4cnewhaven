//JS code for randNum
var oneDayInMs = 1000*60*60*24;
var currentTimeInMs = new Date().getTime();  // UTC time
var timeInDays = Math.floor(currentTimeInMs / oneDayInMs);
var numberForToday = timeInDays % 9999;
console.log(numberForToday);
// zero-filling of numbers less than four digits might be optional for you
// zero-filled value will be a string to maintain its leading 0s
var fourDigitNumber = numberForToday.toString();
while(fourDigitNumber.length < 4)
{
  fourDigitNumber = 0+fourDigitNumber;
}
console.log(fourDigitNumber);
